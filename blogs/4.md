# Linux shell process-substitution

```bash
cmd1 < <(cmd2)
```

This saves `cmd2` stdin output into a pseudo-file known as `/dev/fd/63 -> /proc/self/fd/63`.  
It's not an actual file, you can pass it to a command as an anonymous pipe and it's useless afterwords.

**`/proc/self` is linked to the program accessing it (pid), so it's forbidden for other programs.**
