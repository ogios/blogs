Things could be different when using different kernels.

You might need to install the kernel headers: `linux-headers`. For other kernels like `zen`(which is what i'm using) it's `linux-zen-headers`.

Install `nvidia/nvidia-lts` package for `linux/linux-lts` kernel, and `nvidia-dkms` for other kernels like `zen` which is what i'm using.

dkms provide build and install functionality for every other kernels.  
For more details on `dkms`: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support#Installation

Don't forget to install `nvidia-utils` and `lib32-nvidia-utils`.

Additional note, if you find your self with `AMD Ryzen cpu with intergrated gpu` maybe it's better not to use `nvidia-open(-lts/dkms)` until this [`issue`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/282) solved.
