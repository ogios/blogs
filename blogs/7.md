## `Fn` `FnMut` and `FnOnce` under `closure`

- `Fn` is the most _flexible_ one, it can be called multiple times without any restrictions since they don't have any changes to their environment.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Debug)]
  struct SomeStruct {
      param: i32,
  }

  fn check() {
      let s = SomeStruct { param: 1 };
      let func = || {
          println!("{:?}", s);
      };
      func() // func is recognized as `impl Fn()`
  }
  ```

- `FnMut` means there's _environment_ changes in the function:

  ```rust
  #[derive(Debug)]
  struct SomeStruct {
      param: i32,
  }

  fn use_change() {
      let mut s = SomeStruct { param: 1 };
      let mut func = || {       // for why `FmMut` variable must have `mut`, check: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/why-must-closure-variable-be-mut/53583/3
          s.param = 0;
      };
      func() // function is recognized as `impl FnMut()` since it changes `s` in it's environment
  }
  ```

  it can also run multiple times, but since in rust `mut` for one variable can only exist once in the same scope, this is not allowed:

  ```rust
  // WILL NOT COMPILE
  fn use_change() {
      let mut s = SomeStruct { param: 1 };
      let mut func1 = || {
          s.param = 0;
      };
      let mut func2 = || {
          s.param = 1;      // can not borrow the same variable twice which we did here to `s.param`, but you can still change other params under `s`
      };
      func1();
      func2();
  }
  ```

  - `FnOnce` means the function will only be executed once, this is special because you have to specify this in some circumstances:

  ```rust
  // WILL NOT COMPILE
  fn use_change1() {
    fn setup(s: SomeStruct) -> impl Fn() -> Box<dyn Fn()> { //here we use `Fn` not `FnOnce`
        move || {
            Box::new(move || {
                println!("{:?}", s);
            })
        }
    }
    let func = setup(SomeStruct { param: 1 });

    // you might want to just call it once, but without specifically saying it's a `FnOnce`, compiler will assume:

    let b1 = func(); // box of print function
    let b2 = func(); // box of print function
                     // `s` is passed to `b1` in the first call of `func`, there's nothing left for `b2` unless `SomeStruct` implemented `Copy` trait
  }
  ```

## impl Trait for Trait

> [!WARNING]
> `#[derive]` won't work

```rust
trait Test1 {}
trait Test2 {
    fn t(&self) {}
}
impl Test2 for dyn Test1 {
    fn t(&self) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Return a closure that uses self

This is usually a good idea to directly use `self` in side a closure that that lives longer than current function.  
Unless it implements `Copy` or `Clone`, you can `self.clone()` from outside and _move_ that cloned variable inside closure.
But this is only for `FnOnce` since that cloned variable will be dropped after closure returned.

If you wish to run it multiple times, then you have to specify the lifetime, for example:

```rust
// WILL NOT COMPILE
struct S {
    d: usize,
}
impl S {
    fn caller_(&mut self) -> Box<dyn FnMut()> {
        Box::new(|| self.d += 1)           // here, it will raise:
                                           // lifetime may not live long enough returning this value requires that `'1` must outlive `'static`
    }
}
```

But not only errors are shown, it gives us help: _to declare that the trait object captures data from argument `self`, you can add an explicit `'_`lifetime bound:` + '_`_  
As for why is this needed here, maybe this means that it wants you to make sure that closure is actually try to borrow `self`? idk for now.

But whatever, this works:

```rust
fn caller_(&mut self) -> Box<dyn FnMut() + '_> {
    Box::new(|| self.d += 1)
}
```

As to what [The Rust Reference/Lifetime elision]() said: _If the receiver has type `&Self` or `&mut Self`, then the lifetime of that reference to Self is assigned to all elided output lifetime parameters._  
And so what we do up there ca be translated to:

```rust
fn caller<'a>(&'a mut self) -> Box<dyn FnMut() + 'a> {
    Box::new(|| self.d += 1)
}
```

## Pass in a closure which uses variable from outer scope

If you're using `FnOnce` then just add `move` in front.

But if the closure will be called multiple times, implementing `Fn / FnMut / FnOnce` for your own `struct` could work, but this feature in only available under `nightly` currently(see [#29625](`https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29625`])).

Or you can specify a trait and add `fn call(&self)`/`fn call_mut(&mut self)` yourself and combine with the struct that holds all of the variable inside that scope, pass in the struct and call `call/call_mut`.

## WTF?! Why `borrow` and `borrow_mut` not working?

Simply removes `use std::borrow::{Borrow, BorrowMut}` from your code.
