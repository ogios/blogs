## `Fn` `FnMut` and `FnOnce` under `closure`

- `Fn` is the most _flexible_ one, it can be called multiple times without any restrictions since they don't have any changes to their environment.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Debug)]
  struct SomeStruct {
      param: i32,
  }

  fn check() {
      let s = SomeStruct { param: 1 };
      let func = || {
          println!("{:?}", s);
      };
      func() // func is recognized as `impl Fn()`
  }
  ```

- `FnMut` means there's _environment_ changes in the function:

  ```rust
  #[derive(Debug)]
  struct SomeStruct {
      param: i32,
  }

  fn use_change() {
      let mut s = SomeStruct { param: 1 };
      let mut func = || {       // for why `FmMut` variable must have `mut`, check: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/why-must-closure-variable-be-mut/53583/3
          s.param = 0;
      };
      func() // function is recognized as `impl FnMut()` since it changes `s` in it's environment
  }
  ```

  it can also run multiple times, but since in rust `mut` for one variable can only exist once in the same scope, this is not allowed:

  ```rust
  // WILL NOT COMPILE
  fn use_change() {
      let mut s = SomeStruct { param: 1 };
      let mut func1 = || {
          s.param = 0;
      };
      let mut func2 = || {
          s.param = 1;      // can not borrow the same variable twice which we did here to `s.param`, but you can still change other params under `s`
      };
      func1();
      func2();
  }
  ```

  - `FnOnce` means the function will only be executed once, this is special because you have to specify this in some circumstances:

  ```rust
  // WILL NOT COMPILE
  fn use_change1() {
    fn setup(s: SomeStruct) -> impl Fn() -> Box<dyn Fn()> { //here we use `Fn` not `FnOnce`
        move || {
            Box::new(move || {
                println!("{:?}", s);
            })
        }
    }
    let func = setup(SomeStruct { param: 1 });

    // you might want to just call it once, but without specifically saying it's a `FnOnce`, compiler will assume:

    let b1 = func(); // box of print function
    let b2 = func(); // box of print function
                     // `s` is passed to `b1` in the first call of `func`, there's nothing left for `b2` unless `SomeStruct` implemented `Copy` trait
  }
  ```
