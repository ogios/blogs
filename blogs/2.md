# Running x11 GUI app which require root privileges under wayland

> [!NOTE]

**Conclusion:** run with `sudo -E`

## Useless words

Simply run it may not work since it calls `xhost` which is normal for x11 clients, they need to connect to x11 server to work.

but wayland does not comes with xhost, so it will raise error:

```
◉ grub-customizer
sh: line 1: xhost: command not found
==== AUTHENTICATING FOR org.freedesktop.policykit.exec ====
Authentication is needed to run `/sbin/grub-customizer no-fork' as the super user
Authenticating as: ogios
Password:
polkit-agent-helper-1: error response to PolicyKit daemon: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1.Error.Failed: No session for cookie
==== AUTHENTICATION FAILED ====
Error executing command as another user: Not authorized

This incident has been reported.
sh: line 1: xhost: command not found
```

Simply run with `sudo` does not work either:

```
1s ◉ sudo grub-customizer
[sudo] password for ogios:
Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified
(grub-customizer:4260): Gtk-WARNING **: 10:28:12.657: cannot open display: :0
```
