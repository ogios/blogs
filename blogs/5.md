# Linux shell boolean and cmd exit code

Stuffs like `if` and `while` in shell scripts is not work as what we normally think(boolean).  
They are actually bind with exit code of a program.

```plaintext
true -> exit code 0
false -> exit code not 0
```

You can get the code with `$?` after a command exits:

```bash
true # or [[ -1 -gt 0 ]]
echo $?    #`true` is interpreted as a cmd, and exit code is 0
# result: 0

false # or [[ 1 -gt 0 ]]
echo $?
# result: 1
```

That means you can do commands in places for `if` or `while` as long as the command exit normally.

```bash
# example
cat "$1" | while IFS= read -r last; do echo $?; done
# read always exit with code 0 until there so no content in anonymous pipe
```
