## admonition

!!! info Publish ESM and CJS in a single package
In the past decade, due to the lack of a standard module system of \`JavaScript\`, **CommonJS** (a.k.a the \`require('xxx')\` and \`module.exports\` syntax) has been the way how Node.js and NPM packages work. Until 2015, when ECMAScript modules finally show up as the standard solution, the community start migrating to native ESM gradually.

## table

Easily denote cells that should span multiple columns by grouping multiple pipe | characters at the end of the cell:

| H1                        | H2  | H3  |
| ------------------------- | --- | --- |
| This cell spans 3 columns |     |     |

---

Easily denote cells that should span across the previous row by inserting a caret ^ character immediately before the closing pipes:

| H1            | H2     |
| ------------- | ------ |
| This cell     | Cell A |
| spans three ^ | Cell B |
| rows ^        | Cell C |

Cell contents across rows will be concatenated together with a single whitespace character . Note that cells can only span multiple rows if they have the same column span.

---

Headers can now follow the same structure as cells, to include multiple rows, and also support row and column spans.

| This header spans two || Header A |
| columns _and_ two rows ^|| Header B |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| Cell A | Cell B | Cell C |

      - Subitem 2

[^@#$%]: A footnote on the label: "@#$%".

## highlight

const highlight = "code";
```

```html title="Code title"
<div class="foo">Hello, World!</div>
